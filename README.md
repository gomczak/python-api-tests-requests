# Python API tests requests
*Created for educational use as part of 'Automated tests in CI' (CanTest IT) training.*

*All tests cases **were generated by AI.***


## Overview

It demonstrates fundamental concepts of automated API testing using Python and the Requests library, together with continuous integration (CI) pipelines for test automation.


## Features

- Automated REST API tests written in Python  
- Tests utilize the `requests` library and `pytest` framework  
- Integration with **CI pipelines** for automated test execution  
- Example configurations for both **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**

## Continuous Integration

The repository is designed to run automated tests in popular CI environments:

| CI Pipeline      | Description                                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Actions   | Runs tests on each commit or pull request automatically     |
| Jenkins          | Jenkinsfile included for local or server automation         |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gomczak/python-api-tests-requests.git
   cd python-api-tests-requests
   ```
   
2. **(Recommended) Set up a Python virtual environment:**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     python -m venv .venv
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   *This helps isolate project dependencies from your global Python installation.*

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Tests

To execute the test suite locally:
```sh
pytest
```


## Continuous Integration Pipelines

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions will automatically run all tests on each pull request or push to the repository, providing instant feedback and build status. The workflow configuration can be found under `.github/workflows/`.

### Jenkins

A Jenkinsfile is provided for configuring Jenkins as an alternative or additional CI pipeline. You can integrate it directly with your Jenkins server to automate test execution.

## Notes

- All tests are for demonstration and learning (API provided by [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
- Generated test cases may require adaptation for real-world APIs or systems.
